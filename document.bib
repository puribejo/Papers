	abstract = {The OMNeT++ discrete event simulation environment has been publicly available since 1997. It has been created with the simulation of communication networks, multiprocessors and other distributed systems in mind as application area, but instead of building a specialized simulator, OMNeT++ was designed to be as general as possible. Since then, the idea has proven to work, and OMNeT++ has been used in numerous domains from queuing network simulations to wireless and ad-hoc network simulations, from business process simulation to peer-to-peer network, optical switch and storage area network simulations. This paper presents an overview of the OMNeT++ framework, recent challenges brought about by the growing amount and complexity of third party simulation models, and the solutions we introduce in the next major revision of the simulation framework.},
